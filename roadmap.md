# Roadmap for cookie.js

Some things I plan to add to cookie.js:

- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and CommonJS support. Although there is probably little code that has to be changed: this will take a while because I just have little node knowledge right now. (You are very welcome to contribute to the code!)
- A new method that only sets a cookie if it doesn't exist yet and then returns the value of the cookie.
